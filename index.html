<q><i>What I've come to see as probably my greatest gift is the ability to take an extraordinarily complex, integrated, multidimensional problem and get arms around it conceptually in a way that helps, that informs and empowers practitioners to actually do things.</i></q> - <b>Porter 2010</b><br/></p>
<p>
Porter's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porter%27s_five_forces_analysis" target="_blank">Five forces analysis</a> is a framework that attempts to analyze the level of competition within an industry and business strategy development.
